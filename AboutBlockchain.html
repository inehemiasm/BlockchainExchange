        <p style="color:whitesmoke; font-size: 14pt">History</p>
        <hr>

        <p style="color:whitesmoke">The first blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as
            Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. Nakamoto improved the design in an important way using a Hashcash-like method to
            add blocks to the chain without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party. The design was implemented
            the following year by Nakamoto as a core component of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, where it serves as the
            public ledger for all transactions on the network. In August 2014, the bitcoin blockchain file size,
            containing records of all transactions that have occurred on the network, reached 20 GB (gigabytes).In
            January 2015, the size had grown to almost 30 GB, and from January 2016 to January 2017, the bitcoin
            blockchain grew from 50 GB to 100 GB in size. The words block and chain were used separately in Satoshi
            Nakamoto's original paper, but were eventually popularized as a single word, blockchain, by 2016. The term
            blockchain 2.0 refers to new applications of the distributed blockchain database, first emerging in 2014.
            The Economist described one implementation of this second-generation programmable blockchain as coming with
            "a programming language that allows users to write more sophisticated smart contracts, thus creating
            invoices that pay themselves when a shipment arrives or share certificates which automatically send their
            owners dividends if profits reach a certain level." As of 2016, blockchain 2.0 implementations continue to
            require an off-chain oracle to access any "external data or events based on time or market conditions to
            interact with the blockchain." IBM opened a blockchain innovation research center in Singapore in July
            2016. A working group for the World Economic Forum met in November 2016 to discuss the development of
            governance models related to blockchain. According to Accenture, an application of the diffusion of
            innovations theory suggests that blockchains attained a 13.5% adoption rate within financial services in
            2016, therefore reaching the early adopters phase.Industry trade groups joined to create the Global
            Blockchain Forum in 2016, an initiative of the Chamber of Digital Commerce.</p>

        <p style="color:whitesmoke; font-size: 14pt">Structure</p>
        <hr>

        <p style="color:whitesmoke"> A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed and public digital ledger that is
            used to record transactions across many computers so that any involved record cannot be altered
            retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent blocks.This allows the participants to verify and
            audit transactions independently and relatively inexpensively. A blockchain database is managed
            autonomously using a peer-to-peer network and a distributed timestamping server. They are authenticated by
            mass collaboration powered by collective self-interests. Such a design facilitates robust workflow where
            participants' uncertainty regarding data security is marginal. The use of a blockchain removes the
            characteristic of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset. It confirms that each unit of value was
            transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of double spending. A blockchain has been
            described as a value-exchange protocol. This blockchain-based exchange of value can be completed quicker,
            safer and cheaper than with traditional systems. A blockchain can maintain title rights because, when
            properly set up to detail the exchange agreement, it provides a record that compels offer and acceptance.</p>

        <p style="color:whitesmoke; font-size: 14pt">Blocks</p>
        <hr>

        <p style="color:whitesmoke"> Blocks hold batches of valid transactions that are hashed and encoded into a
            Merkle tree. Each block includes the cryptographic hash of the prior block in the blockchain, linking the
            two. The linked blocks form a chain. This iterative process confirms the integrity of the previous block,
            all the way back to the original genesis block.
            Sometimes separate blocks can be produced concurrently, creating a temporary fork. In addition to a secure
            hash-based history, any blockchain has a specified algorithm for scoring different versions of the history
            so that one with a higher value can be selected over others. Blocks not selected for inclusion in the chain
            are called orphan blocks. Peers supporting the database have different versions of the history from time to
            time. They keep only the highest-scoring version of the database known to them. Whenever a peer receives a
            higher-scoring version (usually the old version with a single new block added) they extend or overwrite
            their own database and retransmit the improvement to their peers. There is never an absolute guarantee that
            any particular entry will remain in the best version of the history forever. Blockchains are typically
            built to add the score of new blocks onto old blocks and are given incentives to extend with new blocks
            rather than overwrite old blocks. Therefore, the probability of an entry becoming superseded decreases
            exponentially[25] as more blocks are built on top of it, eventually becoming very low. For example, in a
            blockchain using the proof-of-work system, the chain with the most cumulative proof-of-work is always
            considered the valid one by the network. There are a number of methods that can be used to demonstrate a
            sufficient level of computation. Within a blockchain the computation is carried out redundantly rather than
            in the traditional segregated and parallel manner.</p>
        <hr>
        <p style="color:whitesmoke; font-size: 14pt">Block Time</p>
        <hr>

        <p style="color:whitesmoke">The block time is the average time it takes for the network to generate one extra
            block in the blockchain. Some blockchains create a new block as frequently as every five seconds. By the
            time of block completion, the included data becomes verifiable. In cryptocurrency, this is practically when
            the transaction takes place, so a shorter block time means faster transactions. The block time for Ethereum
            is set to between 14 and 15 seconds, while for bitcoin it is 10 minutes.</p>
        <hr>
        <p style="color:whitesmoke; font-size: 14pt">Hard forks</p>
        <hr>

        <p style="color:whitesmoke">A hard fork is a rule change such that the software validating according to the old
            rules will see the blocks produced according to the new rules as invalid. In case of a hard fork, all nodes
            meant to work in accordance with the new rules need to upgrade their software. If one group of nodes
            continues to use the old software while the other nodes use the new software, a split can occur. For
            example, Ethereum has hard-forked to "make whole" the investors in The DAO, which had been hacked by
            exploiting a vulnerability in its code. In this case, the fork resulted in a split creating Ethereum and
            Ethereum Classic chains. In 2014 the Nxt community was asked to consider a hard fork that would have led to
            a rollback of the blockchain records to mitigate the effects of a theft of 50 million NXT from a major
            cryptocurrency exchange. The hard fork proposal was rejected, and some of the funds were recovered after
            negotiations and ransom payment.

            Alternatively, to prevent a permanent split, a majority of nodes using the new software may return to the
            old rules, as was the case of bitcoin split on 12 March 2013.</p>

        <p style="color:whitesmoke; font-size: 14pt">Decentralization</p>
        <hr>

        <p style="color:whitesmoke">By storing data across its peer-to-peer network, the blockchain eliminates a number
            of risks that come with data being held centrally.The decentralized blockchain may use ad-hoc message
            passing and distributed networking.

            Peer-to-peer blockchain networks lack centralized points of vulnerability that computer crackers can
            exploit; likewise, it has no central point of failure. Blockchain security methods include the use of
            public-key cryptography.A public key (a long, random-looking string of numbers) is an address on the
            blockchain. Value tokens sent across the network are recorded as belonging to that address. A private key
            is like a password that gives its owner access to their digital assets or the means to otherwise interact
            with the various capabilities that blockchains now support. Data stored on the blockchain is generally
            considered incorruptible.

            Every node in a decentralized system has a copy of the blockchain. Data quality is maintained by massive
            database replication and computational trust. No centralized "official" copy exists and no user is
            "trusted" more than any other. Transactions are broadcast to the network using software. Messages are
            delivered on a best-effort basis. Mining nodes validate transactions, add them to the block they are
            building, and then broadcast the completed block to other nodes.Blockchains use various time-stamping
            schemes, such as proof-of-work, to serialize changes. Alternative consensus methods include proof-of-stake.
            Growth of a decentralized blockchain is accompanied by the risk of centralization because the computer
            resources required to process larger amounts of data become more expensive.</p>
        <hr>
        <p style="color:whitesmoke; font-size: 14pt">Openess</p>
        <hr>

        <p style="color:whitesmoke">Open blockchains are more user-friendly than some traditional ownership records,
            which, while open to the public, still require physical access to view. Because all early blockchains were
            permissionless, controversy has arisen over the blockchain definition. An issue in this ongoing debate is
            whether a private system with verifiers tasked and authorized (permissioned) by a central authority should
            be considered a blockchain.Proponents of permissioned or private chains argue that the term "blockchain"
            may be applied to any data structure that batches data into time-stamped blocks. These blockchains serve as
            a distributed version of multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) in databases. Just as MVCC prevents two
            transactions from concurrently modifying a single object in a database, blockchains prevent two
            transactions from spending the same single output in a blockchain.Opponents say that permissioned systems
            resemble traditional corporate databases, not supporting decentralized data verification, and that such
            systems are not hardened against operator tampering and revision. Nikolai Hampton of Computerworld said
            that "many in-house blockchain solutions will be nothing more than cumbersome databases," and "without a
            clear security model, proprietary blockchains should be eyed with suspicion."</p>
